# X-Team 69 Rules

These rules establish how our team will assign tasks,
track progress on each task, and communicate with each other 
when a member is unable to complete a task that has been assigned to that member.

This document helps individual members understand the team's expectations,
and will hopefully lead to productive team work with fewer conflicts
and missed deadlines.

1. How we will assign (and reassign) tasks

 First Come, First Serve.
 Then communicate with team on progress
 Then determine to either let them continue with what they're doing, help them, or reassign task to different member.

2. How will we will track progress (and follow-up) on completion of tasks

  Uploading code to github with comments, also send comments to everyone via email.

3. How will we communicate difficulties with a task assigned to us

 Put comments on the projects to let them know what the issues are and email others promptly.

4. How we will back up each other to ensure that deadlines are not missed

Build a group on facebook and start the work as soon as possible.
